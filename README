# Helm deployment of the app

Built Helm deployment with an ability to enable hpa, for pod autoscaling, in case we would want to scale vertically we could add vpa.

You can install app by running `helm install swish-app swish-app` from the root directory

I did face some issues with getting app deployed to k8s, i did create the terraform to deploy eks cluster with add-ons and managed node group, cluster was deployed successfully but i did face some networking issues, that i would probably need more time to troubleshoot

For ci/cd, we can use pretty much any solution, since we deploy with helm and all the values are easily configurable in values.yaml file, but i think for the one stop shop i would personally use Jenkins, just because it gives an ability to build, test, deploy all together in one pipeline.

i'll link eks cluster repo, so you could see that cluster is being configured by the best practices
